# Operating-Systems-Lab
This repository contains OS Lab experiments covering Linux commands, shell scripting, file operations, and process control. 
Topics include directory management, chmod, vi editor, loops, conditionals, and Makefile-based project compilation.
This is the hands-on guide to understanding core OS concepts.

List of Experiments:

Experiment 1: Basic Linux Commands This experiment covers essential Linux commands, including: Listing directory contents (ls) Viewing file content (cat) Printing the current directory (pwd) Displaying the current user name (whoami) Clearing the terminal (clear) Creating and deleting directories (mkdir, rmdir) Navigating directories (cd, cd ..) Creating, appending, copying, renaming, and deleting files (cat, cp, mv, rm).

Experiment 2: Directory and File Manipulation This experiment demonstrates creating and managing directories and files: Creating a main directory Animal with subdirectories mammals and reptiles Creating files (cow.txt and lizard.txt) in the mammals directory with content about respective animals Moving lizard.txt from the mammals directory to the reptiles directory.
Here is the text decrypted from the image:

Experiment 3: Create a directory Vehicle. In Vehicle create four directories with names Fourwheelers, Threewheelers, Twowheelers. In Fourwheelers create directories Bus, Car, Truck. In Threewheelers create directories Auto. In Twowheelers create directories Cycle and Scooty. 
In the Car directory, create files: Carbrand.txt, Busbrand.txt, Truckbrand.txt, Autocolor.txt, Cyclebrand.txt. Write 2 lines in each file. Move each file to their respective directories. Also, delete the Cycle directory finally.

Experiment 4: Learning the use of chmod command and vi text editor.

Experiment 5: If-Else statements in bash.

Experiment 6: For Loop in Shell Programming.

Experiment 7: Building C Project using makefile.

EXP 08: Basic Programs in Shell Scripting.

EXP 09: To study and implement the read(), write(), and fork() system calls in Unix/Linux operating systems.

EXP 10:Program to create orphan process and zombie process.

EXP 11:Program to create threads in Linux

EXP 12:Write a program for Process Synchronization using mutex lock.
