This repository contains practical experiments conducted as part of the Operating Systems Lab. Each file represents a specific experiment, demonstrating key concepts and algorithms in operating systems.

Experiment 1: Basic Linux Commands This experiment covers essential Linux commands, including: Listing directory contents (ls) Viewing file content (cat) Printing the current directory (pwd) Displaying the current user name (whoami) Clearing the terminal (clear) Creating and deleting directories (mkdir, rmdir) Navigating directories (cd, cd ..) Creating, appending, copying, renaming, and deleting files (cat, cp, mv, rm).

Experiment 2: Directory and File Manipulation This experiment demonstrates creating and managing directories and files: Creating a main directory Animal with subdirectories mammals and reptiles Creating files (cow.txt and lizard.txt) in the mammals directory with content about respective animals Moving lizard.txt from the mammals directory to the reptiles directory.
Here is the text decrypted from the image:

Experiment 3: Create a directory Vehicle. In Vehicle create four directories with names Fourwheelers, Threewheelers, Twowheelers. In Fourwheelers create directories Bus, Car, Truck. In Threewheelers create directories Auto. In Twowheelers create directories Cycle and Scooty. 
In the Car directory, create files: Carbrand.txt, Busbrand.txt, Truckbrand.txt, Autocolor.txt, Cyclebrand.txt. Write 2 lines in each file. Move each file to their respective directories. Also, delete the Cycle directory finally.

Experiment 4: Learning the use of chmod command and vi text editor.

Experiment 5: If-Else statements in bash.

Experiment 6: For Loop in Shell Programming.

Experiment 7: Building C Project using makefile.
