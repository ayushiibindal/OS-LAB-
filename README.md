# Operating-Systems-Lab
This repository contains OS Lab experiments covering Linux commands, shell scripting, file operations, and process control. 
Topics include directory management, chmod, vi editor, loops, conditionals, and Makefile-based project compilation.
This is the hands-on guide to understanding core OS concepts.

List of Experiments:

Experiment 1: Basic Linux Commands.

Experiment 2: Directory and File Manipulation This experiment demonstrates creating and managing directories and files: Creating a main directory Animal with subdirectories mammals and reptiles Creating files (cow.txt and lizard.txt) in the mammals directory with content about respective animals Moving lizard.txt from the mammals directory to the reptiles directory.
Here is the text decrypted from the image:

Experiment 3: Create a directory Vehicle. In Vehicle create four directories with names Fourwheelers, Threewheelers, Twowheelers. In Fourwheelers create directories Bus, Car, Truck. In Threewheelers create directories Auto. In Twowheelers create directories Cycle and Scooty. 
In the Car directory, create files: Carbrand.txt, Busbrand.txt, Truckbrand.txt, Autocolor.txt, Cyclebrand.txt. Write 2 lines in each file. Move each file to their respective directories. Also, delete the Cycle directory finally.

Experiment 4: Learning the use of chmod command and vi text editor.

Experiment 5: If-Else statements in bash.

Experiment 6: For Loop in Shell Programming.

Experiment 7: Building C Project using makefile.

Experiment 8: Basic Programs in Shell Scripting.

Experiment 09: To study and implement the read(), write(), and fork() system calls in Unix/Linux operating systems.

Experiment 10: Program to create orphan process and zombie process.

Experiment 11: Program to create threads in Linux

Experiment 12: Write a program for Process Synchronization using mutex lock.
